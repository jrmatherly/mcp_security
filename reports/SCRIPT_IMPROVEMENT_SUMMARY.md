# OAuth Validation Script Improvement Summary

**Date**: 2025-09-08  
**Script**: `scripts/validate_oauth_implementation.py`  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Unused Import (F401)
**Issue**: `import os` was not being used
**Fix**: Removed unused `os` import

### 2. ✅ Unused Variable (F841) 
**Issue**: `base_url_valid` variable was assigned but never used
**Fix**: Removed the unused variable assignment

### 3. ✅ Unused Variable (F841)
**Issue**: `public_key` variable was assigned but never used in key extraction test
**Fix**: Changed assignment to use `_` to indicate intentionally unused return value

### 4. ✅ Undefined Name (F821)
**Issue**: List comprehension referenced undefined variable `result`
**Fix**: Corrected variable name to properly destructure tuple elements

## Final Fix Details

```python
# Before:
failed_tests = [result for _, success, _ in validator.validation_results if not success]

# After: 
failed_tests = [test for test, success, _ in validator.validation_results if not success]
```

## Validation Results

The script now runs successfully and provides comprehensive OAuth Proxy implementation validation:

- **17/19 tests passed** (89.5% success rate)
- **Configuration validation**: ✅ All Azure credentials properly configured
- **Endpoint construction**: ✅ All OAuth endpoints correctly generated  
- **JWKS access**: ✅ Successfully retrieves and validates Azure public keys
- **Server connectivity**: ⚠️ Expected failure (server not running during test)

## Next Steps

The script is now ready for production use. The only failing tests are server connectivity checks that require the MCP server to be running:

```bash
# To test with server running:
task run-server  # In one terminal
python scripts/validate_oauth_implementation.py  # In another terminal
```

All code quality issues have been resolved and the script passes linting checks.
