# Article Update Plan: Matching Reality to Documentation

## Overview
This plan outlines the updates needed to bring `docs/article.md` in line with our actual implementation. The article contains theoretical code and planned features, while our implementation has working code that differs in significant ways.

## Analysis Summary

### What We Actually Built vs. Article Plans

**‚úÖ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS:**
1. **FastMCP 2.8+ Server** - Article shows older FastMCP patterns, we use 2.8+ with streamable-http transport
2. **OAuth 2.1 Server** - Article has theoretical OAuth, we have working server with PKCE
3. **nginx TLS Configuration** - Article has basic nginx config, we have production-ready setup
4. **OpenAI Client Integration** - Article has complex theoretical code, we have simpler working implementation
5. **Input Validation with Pydantic v2** - Article uses v1 patterns, we use v2 field validators
6. **Rate Limiting System** - Article has Redis-only approach, we have memory + Redis fallback
7. **SSL Certificate Management** - Article mentions certificates, we have mkcert + combined CA bundle system
8. **Docker Deployment** - Article has basic Docker mention, we have full docker-compose with nginx
9. **Environment Configuration** - Article has scattered config, we have .env-based system

**üîÑ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED:**
1. **Security Monitoring** - We have basic logging, article shows comprehensive monitoring
2. **Tool Scope Validation** - We have basic scopes, article shows detailed mapping
3. **Distributed Rate Limiting** - We have Redis support but simplified implementation

**‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED (TODO):**
1. **Anthropic Native Integration** - Article has detailed implementation, we don't have this
2. **LangChain Integration** - Article shows enterprise security wrapper, not implemented
3. **DSPy Integration** - Article has secure DSPy module, not implemented  
4. **LiteLLM Integration** - Article has universal gateway, not implemented
5. **Claude Desktop Configuration** - Article has OAuth wrapper, we don't have this
6. **Comprehensive Security Checklist** - Article has audit checklist, we need to implement
7. **Advanced Security Monitoring** - Article shows correlation IDs, anomaly detection, etc.
8. **PKCE Code Challenge Generation** - Article shows manual PKCE, we use simplified OAuth

## Success Criteria

1. **Code Accuracy**: All code examples in the article should be copy-pasteable and functional, no wider than 60 characters 
2. **Implementation Matching**: Article accurately reflects what we actually built
3. **Clear Separation**: Clear distinction between implemented features and TODO items
4. **Practical Guidance**: Readers can follow the article to replicate our working system
5. **Future Planning**: TODO items provide clear roadmap for future development

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Preserve Future Plans**: Don't delete unimplemented features, move them to TODO, don't remove them from article
2. **Maintain Article Flow**: Keep the overall narrative structure intact
3. **Version Compatibility**: Ensure all examples work with our current dependency versions
4. **Security Accuracy**: Double-check all security implementations for accuracy

# Code Listing Format Guidelines

You are an expert in Python, Bash, YAML and Markdown editing. Ensure the following rules for code listings:

1. **Line Length:** Ensure the maximum width of any line is 60 characters.
    1. NO PYTHON LINE OF CODE WILL BE MORE THAN 60 CHARACTERS!
    2. This is a must to display properly on LinkedIn and Medium
2. **Syntax Accuracy:** Preserve syntactic correctness in Python.
3. **Comments Handling:**
    - If end-of-line comments exceed the width limit, move them to the line before the code block, or break them into multiple lines.
    - If docstrings or comments are too long, break them into multiple lines while maintaining readability and coherence. **Do not truncate or lose any part of the original meaning of the comment.**
    - COMMENTS MUST BE FIXED SUCH THAT NO LINE IS GREATER THAN 60 CHARACTERS!
4. NO CODE LISTING OF ANY KIND IS ALLOWED TO HAVE A LINE OVER 60 characters.

Format and edit the code listings according to these guidelines.
